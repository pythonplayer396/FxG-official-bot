- [ ] Database saves warnings/logs
- [ ] Auto-moderation working

## ‚úÖ Production Ready

- [ ] All tests passed
- [ ] Logging configured
- [ ] Security features enabled
- [ ] Role permissions verified
- [ ] Documentation reviewed
- [ ] Team trained on commands

## üîß Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work:

1. **Bot doesn't respond**
   - [ ] Check if bot is online
   - [ ] Verify commands deployed
   - [ ] Check console for errors
   - [ ] Verify bot permissions

2. **Permission errors**
   - [ ] Check role IDs in `src/config.js`
   - [ ] Verify user has correct role
   - [ ] Check role hierarchy

3. **Database errors**
   - [ ] Verify MongoDB is running
   - [ ] Check MONGODB_URI in `.env`
   - [ ] Check console for connection errors

4. **Music not working**
   - [ ] User must be in voice channel
   - [ ] Bot needs voice permissions
   - [ ] Check console for errors

## üìù Notes

- Server owner bypasses all permission checks
- Bot owner bypasses all permission checks
- Discord Administrator permission bypasses all checks
- Music commands use embeds (this is intentional)
- All other commands use simple text

## üéØ Next Steps

After setup:
1. Train staff on available commands
2. Configure auto-moderation rules
3. Set up word filters
4. Test with different roles
5. Monitor logs for issues

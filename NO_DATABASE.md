- ✅ Removed all database dependencies from `package.json`

### 2. Removed Commands
**Moderation:**

- `warnings` - View warnings
- `clear-warnings` - Clear warnings

**Admin:**
- `absence` - Staff absence tracking
- `logging` - Log channel configuration

**Utility:**

### 3. Removed Events
- `messageCreate.js` - Word filter & auto-warn
- `messageDelete.js` - Ghost ping detection
- `guildMemberAdd.js` - Anti-raid & join logging
- `guildMemberRemove.js` - Leave logging

### 4. Updated Files
- `src/index.js` - Removed all database connection code
- `src/utils/logger.js` - Now only logs to console
- `package.json` - Removed all database dependencies
- `.env.example` - Removed database variables

## What Remains

### Working Commands
All commands that **don't** require a database still work:
- **Moderation**: ban, unban, kick, timeout, purge, lockdown, etc.
- **Music**: play, pause, skip, queue, volume, etc.
- **Utility**: ping, help, serverinfo, userinfo, etc.
- **Fun**: 8ball, coinflip, dice, etc.

### Bot Features
- ✅ Discord bot with slash commands
- ✅ Music player (discord-player)
- ✅ Basic moderation (kick, ban, timeout, etc.)
- ✅ Utility commands
- ✅ Fun commands
- ❌ No data persistence
- ❌ No web panel
- ❌ No warning system
- ❌ No logging to channels
- ❌ No anti-raid/filter features

## Installation
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Bot
```bash
npm start
```

## Environment Variables
Only these are needed now:
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
GUILD_ID=your_guild_id_here (optional)
```

## Notes
- **Zero database dependencies**
- **No PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or any database**
- Bot is purely stateless
- All actions are logged to console only
- Perfect for simple Discord bot without persistence needs

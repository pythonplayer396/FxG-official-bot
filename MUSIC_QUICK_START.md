Use `/playnext` for important songs:
```
/play background music 1
/play background music 2
/playnext YOUR FAVORITE SONG    ‚Üê This plays next!
```

### 3. Optimize Audio
Try different combinations:
```
For EDM/Electronic:
/equalizer electronic
/filters bassboost
/volume 85

For Rock:
/equalizer rock
/volume 80

For Chill Music:
/equalizer soft
/volume 50
```

### 4. Manage Long Queues
```

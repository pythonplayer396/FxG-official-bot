## Key Features Integrated

### 1. Auto-Create System
- Users join HUB voice channel
- Bot automatically creates a new temp VC
- User is moved to their new channel
- Control panel appears in the channel

### 2. Control Panel
Full-featured control panel with buttons for:
- **Lock/Unlock** - Control who can connect
- **Hide/Unhide** - Control channel visibility
- **Mute/Unmute** - Control who can speak
- **Ban/Unban** - Ban users/roles from channel

### 3. Auto-Cleanup
- Channels deleted 10 seconds after owner leaves
- Ownership transfers if other users present
- Database automatically cleaned up

### 4. Logging System
Two separate logging channels:
- **System logs** - Errors, warnings, system events
- **Activity logs** - User actions, channel events

### 5. Database
- LevelDB database for persistent storage
- Stores ownership, control messages, cooldowns
- Automatic cleanup

## Configuration Required

Before using, you must set these environment variables in `.env`:

```env
TEMP_VC_ENABLED=true
TEMP_VC_HUB_CHANNEL_ID=<your_hub_voice_channel_id>
TEMP_VC_CATEGORY_ID=<your_category_id>
TEMP_VC_DEFAULT_ROLE_ID=<your_everyone_role_id>
TEMP_VC_LOG_CHANNEL_ID=<your_log_channel_id>
TEMP_VC_ACTIVITY_LOG_CHANNEL_ID=<your_activity_log_channel_id>
```

## Next Steps

1. **Create Discord Channels**:
   - Create a HUB voice channel
   - Create a category for temp VCs
   - Create log channels (system & activity)

2. **Configure Environment**:
   - Copy channel IDs to `.env` file
   - Set `TEMP_VC_ENABLED=true`

3. **Deploy Commands**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

4. **Start Bot**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Test System**:
   - Join the HUB channel
   - Verify temp VC is created
   - Test control panel buttons
   - Check logging channels

## Technical Details

### Database Structure
- `tempVcIdKey_<userId>` - Maps user to their temp VC ID
- `tempmsgIdKey_<userId>` - Maps user to control message ID
- `tempTimestampKey_<userId>` - Timestamp of VC creation
- `tempHUBBans` - Cooldown tracking for failed creations

### Permissions Required
The bot needs:
- Manage Channels
- Move Members
- Connect & Speak
- View Channel
- Send Messages
- Embed Links
- Manage Permissions (in category)

### Interaction Flow
1. User joins HUB â†’ `voiceStateUpdate` event
2. Bot creates temp VC â†’ Database entry created
3. User moved to temp VC â†’ Control panel sent
4. User interacts with buttons â†’ `interactionCreate` â†’ `tempvc-interactions.js`
5. User leaves â†’ Timeout starts â†’ Channel deleted â†’ Database cleaned

## Differences from Original

1. **Integrated into existing bot** - Works alongside moderation, music, etc.
2. **Environment-based config** - Uses .env instead of config.js
3. **Modular structure** - Separated into multiple files
4. **Enhanced logging** - Better integration with bot's logging system
5. **Updated embeds** - Branded for FxG

## All-in-One Bot

The FxG-modbot now includes:
- âœ… Moderation commands (ban, kick, warn, timeout, etc.)
- âœ… Music player (play, queue, skip, etc.)
- âœ… Utility commands (serverinfo, userinfo, etc.)
- âœ… **Temporary Voice Channels** (NEW!)

Everything is managed through a single bot with a unified command system.

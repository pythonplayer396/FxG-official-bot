# Changes Made to FxG ModBot

## Summary

The bot has been configured with:
1. **Hardcoded role-based permissions** using your specific role IDs
2. **No embeds** for all commands except music (clean text responses)
3. **Simplified permission system** - no database configuration needed

## Role Configuration

All role IDs have been hardcoded in `src/config.js`:

```javascript
roles: {
    admin: '1296065345424986183',        // Full access
    management: '1308840318690394233',   // Absence & utilities
    moderator: '1379147275346907297',    // Ban, kick, heavy punishments
    helper: '1246460406055178260',       // Warn command
    support: '1268911588992225280'       // Timeout & mute
}
```

## Permission Hierarchy

1. **Admin** (`1296065345424986183`)
   - All commands

2. **Management** (`1308840318690394233`)
   - `/absence` (add, list, remove)
   - All user commands

3. **Moderator** (`1379147275346907297`)
   - `/ban`, `/unban`, `/kick`, `/softban`
   - `/message`
   - All commands below

4. **Helper** (`1246460406055178260`)
   - `/warn`, `/warnings`
   - All commands below

5. **Support** (`1268911588992225280`)
   - `/timeout`
   - `/purge`, `/slowmode`
   - All commands below

6. **Everyone**
   - All music commands
   - All utility commands (`/report`, `/poll`, `/ping`, etc.)

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified

1. **`src/config.js`**
   - Added hardcoded role IDs
   - Removed dynamic role configuration

2. **`src/utils/permissions.js`**
   - Complete rewrite of permission system
   - Added `canUseCommand()` method with role-based checks
   - Removed database-dependent permission checks

3. **`src/utils/messages.js`** (NEW)
   - Simple message formatter
   - Replaces embed system for non-music commands

4. **`src/events/interactionCreate.js`**
   - Updated to use new permission system
   - Removed embed-based error messages
   - Uses simple text responses

5. **All command files** (except music)
   - Replaced `CustomEmbedBuilder` with `Messages`
   - Converted embed responses to simple text
   - Removed `moderatorOnly` and `adminOnly` flags

### Files Unchanged

- **Music commands** (`src/commands/music/*.js`)
  - Still use embeds for better presentation
  - Everyone can use these commands

- **Event handlers** (mostly unchanged)
  - Still log events properly
  - Auto-moderation still works

- **Database models** (unchanged)
  - Warnings, absences, logs still saved to database

## Message Format

### Before (with embeds):
```javascript
await interaction.reply({
    embeds: [CustomEmbedBuilder.success('User Banned', 'User has been banned')]
});
```

### After (simple text):
```javascript
await interaction.reply({
    content: Messages.success('User has been banned')
});
```

### Music Commands (still use embeds):
```javascript
await interaction.reply({
    embeds: [CustomEmbedBuilder.music('Now Playing', 'Song details...')]
});
```

## Benefits

✅ **Simpler responses** - No cluttered embeds
✅ **Faster** - Less data to send
✅ **Cleaner UI** - Minimal, smooth interface
✅ **Hardcoded permissions** - No database setup needed
✅ **Easy to modify** - Just edit `src/config.js` for role IDs

## Music Commands Exception

Music commands still use embeds because:
- Better presentation of song information
- Shows thumbnails and progress bars
- Industry standard for music bots
- Requested by user

## Testing

After starting the bot, test:

1. **Permission system**:
   - Try commands with different roles
   - Verify role hierarchy works

2. **Message format**:
   - All non-music commands should show simple text
   - Music commands should show embeds

3. **Functionality**:
   - All commands should work as before
   - Just different presentation

## Rollback

If you need to revert changes:
1. The old embed system is still available in `src/utils/embedBuilder.js`
2. Music commands show the pattern for using embeds
3. Git history has all previous versions

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Configure `.env` file
3. Deploy commands: `npm run deploy`
4. Start bot: `npm start`
5. Test with different roles

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for detailed setup.
